# SCSS Nintendo Switch

Nintendo Switch made entirely out of divs and SCSS.

Built in VS Code with the extensions "Live Server" and "Live Sass Compiler" - if you want to run this locally that's probably the easiest way. I haven't committed the style.css file for this reason, so you won't just be able to open the index.html file without compiling the SCSS (which Live Sass Compiler takes care of for you).
